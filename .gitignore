## Environment normalisation:
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle

# using bower to install bootstrap tour, which requires bootstrap
# bootstrap is already installed
/vendor/assets/components/bootstrap
# these should all be checked in to normalise the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, 
#.ruby-version
.ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# if using bower-rails ignore default bower_components path bower.json files
