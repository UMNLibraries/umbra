        <h4>Who are the institutions behind <em>Umbra</em>?</h4>
        <p><em>Umbra</em> is developed by the Givens Collection of African American Literature at the University of Minnesota in partnership with the Penumbra Theatre Company.</p>
        <p>Established in 1986, the <a href="https://www.lib.umn.edu/scrbm/givens">Archie Givens, Sr. Collection of African American Literature</a> at the University of Minnesota Libraries contains over 10,000 books, magazines, and pamphlets by or about African Americans. From Phillis Wheatley’s seminal 1773 <em>Poems on Various Subjects Religious and Moral</em> to Minnesota hip-hop, the Givens Collection has particular strength in the areas of the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement. It also holds a significant number of materials that relate to African American education, social sciences, journalism, arts, sports, and entertainment, including the Penumbra Theatre Company archives and the Lou Bellamy Rare Book Collection, which contains over 850 titles including the self-published <em>Narrative of Sojourner Truth</em> and other books that predate the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
        <p>The Givens Collection is located at the Elmer L. Andersen Library in Minneapolis, MN, and is open to the public.</p>
        <p>Lou Bellamy founded <a href="http://penumbratheatre.org/">Penumbra Theatre Company</a> in 1976 to create art that roars with authenticity through the rich and unrestrained voices of black playwrights and artists. The powerful and unapologetic representation of the African American experience defines Penumbra’s art, driving its education programs to provide rigorous scholarship while creating an entry point for everyone. Penumbra’s ultimate goal is to engage audiences in dialogue and action around issues of racism and equity, and renewing our sense of shared responsibility in building healthy, vibrant communities. Penumbra has achieved national recognition for its high quality productions; groundbreaking educational programs and collaborations; the development of new work and launching the career of many artists including two-time Pulitzer Prize winner August Wilson; and for opening avenues to include and celebrate the black experience as part of the American narrative. Penumbra’s Co-Artistic Directors are Lou Bellamy and Sarah Bellamy.</p>

          <h4>How did this idea come to be?</h4>
          <p><em>Umbra: Search African American History</em> is a response to a project dedicated to understanding the role of theater archives in documenting history. However, the scope of <em>Umbra</em> immediately goes far beyond theater and the performing arts. It seeks to bring together the historical artifacts and documents that represent the full depth and breadth of the African American experience—its people, places, ideas, events, movements, and inspirations. It is our hope that this rich history will find new life and form in theater, literature, works of art, journalism, scholarship, teaching curricula, and much more.</p>
          <p>Umbra is inspired by work begun in 2012 with <em><a href="https://www.lib.umn.edu/about/ephemeral/">Preserving the Ephemeral: An Archival Program for Theater and the Performing Arts</a></em>, and was originally conceived as <em>The African American Theater History Project</em>. With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, <em>Preserving the Ephemeral</em> was a collaboration between the University of Minnesota and Penumbra Theatre Company to assess the needs of the theater community, and theaters of color in particular, around questions of archives and historical legacy. Over 300 theater representatives responded to a national survey in partnership with American Theatre Archive Project, and artistic directors and founders from over 60 theaters around the country participated in forums convened to discuss the challenges and heightened importance of archives for culturally specific companies.</p>
