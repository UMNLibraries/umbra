    <strong>What is <em>Umbra</em>?</strong><br />
    <p><em>Umbra</em> is a digital library that brings together materials documenting African American history and cultural life from archives, libraries, museums, and other US repositories. <em>Umbra</em> features thumbnail images and descriptive information about photographs, manuscripts, documents, books, sound files, video files, and other freely available resources.</p>

    <strong>Where can I find <em>Umbra</em>?</strong><br />
    <p>The <em>Umbra</em> site is located at <a href="http://umbrasearch.org">umbrasearch.org</a>. We are also developing a widget that can be embedded in any digital environment, allowing users to access <em>Umbra</em> from other sites. You can also find us on social media. Follow along on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/umbrasearch">@UmbraSearch</a> and Tumblr at <a href="http://umbrasearch.tumblr.com/">umbrasearch.tumblr.com</a>.</p>

    <strong>Where does <em>Umbra</em> content come from?</strong><br />
    <p>Materials come from the collections of partner and contributing institutions—libraries, archives, museums, and other repositories that have made parts of their collections available online. <em>Umbra</em> collects thumbnail images and descriptive information that lead <em>Umbra</em> users to view digital materials in a given library/repository’s home online collection. <a href="http://umbrasearch.org/catalog/facet/dataProvider_ssi?limit=100&q=&search_field=all_fields&facet_view=full">Browse a full list of institutions</a> that are contributing materials to <em>Umbra</em>.</p>
